   -name: ("myself") is the name for the monster.

   -symbol: (S_HUMAN) is the letter used for it. The complete list is defined
   	      in the file monsym.h

   -level: (1). The monster is initially created with this level.

   -move rate: (10). Ranges from 0 -don't move- to 30 -really fast-.

   -AC: (10). Come on! you now quite well what this is.

   -magic resistance: (0). Ranges from 0 -none- to 127 -full-.

   -alignment: (0). negative value means chaotic, positive lawful.

   -creation/geno flags: (G_GENO | G_NOGEN)
   		  these are flags or'ded, with this meaning:

        G_UNIQ          /* generated only once */
	        G_NOHELL        /* not generated in "hell" */
		        G_HELL          /* generated only in "hell" */

   -attack: ({ { AT_WEAP, AD_PHYS, 1, 6 }, NO_ATTK, NO_ATTK,
              NO_ATTK, NO_ATTK, NO_ATTK },)
	            This defines how the monster attacks. This element is composed of six
		          'attack' struct, each one being the form:

			    ( attack_type, damage_type, # of dice, # of sides of each )

      where attack_type is one of:

        AT_NONE         /* passive monster (ex. acid blob) */
	        AT_CLAW         /* claw (punch, hit, etc.) */

														        AT_WEAP         /* uses weapon */
															        AT_MAGC         /* uses magic spell(s) */

      damage_type is one of:

        AD_PHYS         /* ordinary physical */
	        AD_MAGM         /* magic missiles */

																										        AD_DGST         /* digests opponent (trapper, etc.) */
																											        AD_HEAL         /* heals opponent's wounds (nurse) */
																												        AD_WRAP         /* special "stick" for eels */
																													        AD_WERE         /* confers lycanthropy */
																														        AD_DRDX         /* drains dexterity (Quasit) */
																															        AD_DRCO         /* drains constitution */
																																        AD_DRIN         /* drains intelligence (mind flayer) */
																																	        AD_DISE         /* confers diseases */
																																		        AD_DCAY         /* decays organics (Brown pudding) */

																																									        AD_RBRE         /* random breath weapon */
																																										        AD_SAMU         /* hits, may steal Amulet (Wizard) */
																																											        AD_CURS         /* random curse (ex. gremlin) */

      and the # dice/faces sets a range of damage:

           i.e:   1,6     means a possible damage between 1 and 6,
	                 but 3,7     means a possible damage between 3 and 21.

      So, a monster can attack six times per turn at maximum. To attack less
            times use the 'NO_ATTACK' entry.

   -weight: (WT_HUMAN). Can be one of several defines like WT_DRAGON, WT_HUMAN,
         WT_ELF, but also a direct number can be used.

   -nutritional value: (400). The title says it all.

   -extension length: (PL_NSIZ). Here comes a problem...This is the size of an
         extra struct added to the normal permonst if the monster has any. For
	       example, shopkeepers have an extra struct used to manage the shop
	             code, dogs an extra to manage taming levels, etc... For the moment
		           forget about this part.

   -sounds made: (MS_HUMAN). It is one of: (from monflag.h)
